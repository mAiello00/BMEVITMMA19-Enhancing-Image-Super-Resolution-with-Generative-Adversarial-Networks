## Project description
This project is a study of the Image Super Resolution (ISR) domain and will implement GAN-based models, particularily SRGAN and ESRGAN in PyTorch framework. The goal is to generate higher resolution images from lower resolution images. Our overarching goal is to compare traditional interpolation methods such as bilinear and bicubic to GAN-based methods.
